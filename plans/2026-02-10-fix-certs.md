# Plan: Fix Certificates and Deployment Issues

## Problem
1. `biometrics` and `golinks` Certificates are missing in Staging (and possibly Production).
2. `golinks` in Staging uses hostname `go.stage.burntbytes.com` but no corresponding Certificate exists (only `links-stage-tls` exists for Linkding).
3. `biometrics` in Staging uses `bio.stage.burntbytes.com` but has no Certificate.
4. Production Certificates might be missing (though Wildcard exists, explicit certs ensure coverage).

## Steps

### 1. Fix Staging Certificates
- **File**: `apps/staging/certificates/certificates.yaml`
- **Action**: Add Certificate for `golinks-stage-tls` (dns: `go.stage.burntbytes.com`).
- **Action**: Add Certificate for `biometrics-stage-tls` (dns: `bio.stage.burntbytes.com`).

### 2. Fix Production Certificates
- **File**: `apps/production/certificates/certificates.yaml`
- **Action**: Add Certificate for `golinks-prod-tls` (dns: `go.burntbytes.com`).
- **Action**: Add Certificate for `biometrics-prod-tls` (dns: `bio.burntbytes.com`).

### 3. Verify Deployment Config
- Ensure `kustomization.yaml` files reference these new/existing cert files correctly.
- (Self-Correction): Check if `apps/staging/certificates/kustomization.yaml` includes `certificates.yaml`. It does.

## Goal
Ensure valid TLS certificates are generated for both apps in both environments to allow Ingress/Gateway to function correctly, which might be related to the "not running" perception (if via checks) or underlying config validity.
